## Overview

This thesis explores the challenge of concept drift in streaming data environments, where changes in data distribution over time degrade the performance of static machine learning models. The work evaluates how ensemble-based classifiers paired with drift detection algorithms can adapt to these changes and maintain predictive accuracy.

## Key Contributions

- **Drift Detection Techniques**: Implemented and tested ADWIN, DDM, and EDDM to monitor changes in real-time data streams and trigger model retraining.
- **Ensemble Classifiers**: Leveraged ensemble learners to build adaptive classifiers that maintain performance as data evolves.
- **Evaluation with Real and Synthetic Data**: Used Scikit-Multiflow and Python to simulate realistic streaming environments for controlled and practical validation.
- **Performance Metrics**: Assessed accuracy, false-positive rate, and adaptability to compare detection algorithms in dynamic contexts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For simulation, model training, and algorithm implementation.
- **Scikit-Multiflow**: Specialized framework for stream learning and drift detection.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For iterative development and result visualization.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For visual analytics.

## Challenges and Learnings

Key challenges included balancing detection sensitivity with stability, and designing experiments that realistically simulate drift scenarios. Ensuring reliable performance across both synthetic and real-world datasets was another critical aspect. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of adaptive learning systems and the nuances of real-time model management.

## Outcome

The thesis demonstrates that combining ensemble learning with effective drift detection can significantly improve the robustness of machine learning systems in non-stationary environments. These methods have potential applications in fraud detection, network monitoring, and other real-time systems requiring adaptive intelligence.
